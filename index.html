    <!-- 第二部分：项目提案 (Project Proposal) -->
    <div class="section" id="project-proposal">
        <h2>2. Project Proposal</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Project Name</h3>
        <p>AccessMap (Accessible Navigation Map)</p>

        <h3>2.2 Project Background & Objectives</h3>
        <p>Current mainstream navigation apps (e.g., Baidu Maps, Amap, Apple Maps) lack dynamic and user-specific accessibility information. People with mobility impairments—such as wheelchair users, visually impaired individuals, the elderly with arthritis, and temporarily injured people—often encounter barriers like blocked accessible ramps, out-of-service elevators, and discontinuous tactile paving during travel, leading to travel frustration or even giving up going out.</p>
        <p>The core objective of this project is to design the AccessMap app, which integrates crowdsourced data, sensor feedback, and smart device integration to provide <strong>real-time, reliable, and personalized accessible route planning</strong>. It aims to solve the problem of insufficient dynamic accessibility information in current mapping services and improve the travel convenience and safety of people with mobility impairments.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Target Users</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Long-term mobility-impaired groups: Wheelchair users, visually impaired individuals (using canes or screen-reading software)</li>
            <li>Age-related mobility-impaired groups: Elderly people over 60 with mild arthritis (using canes)</li>
            <li>Temporary mobility-impaired groups: People with fractures or ligament strains (using crutches temporarily)</li>
            <li>Indirect users: Ordinary people who take care of relatives with mobility impairments</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.4 Core Functions (Preliminary Design)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Real-time accessibility status update: Display real-time status of facilities like elevators, ramps, and tactile paving (e.g., "elevator in normal use," "ramp blocked")</li>
            <li>Personalized route planning: Customize routes based on user types (e.g., wheelchair users avoid steps, visually impaired users prioritize continuous tactile paving)</li>
            <li>One-click emergency assistance: Connect to family members, 120 emergency services, or nearby volunteers with real-time location sharing</li>
            <li>Voice + vibration navigation: Provide clear voice prompts (with adjustable speed) and smartwatch vibration reminders (left turn vibrates left, right turn vibrates right) for visually impaired users and wheelchair users</li>
            <li>Crowdsourced information reporting: Allow users to upload photos or text reports of accessibility barriers (e.g., "narrow ramp at convenience store") with simplified operation (e.g., voice reporting for the elderly)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- 第三部分：数据收集计划 (Data Collection Plan: Interview/Survey) -->
    <div class="section" id="data-collection-plan">
        <h2>3. Data Collection Plan</h2>
        <p>To verify user needs and pain points, and provide a basis for app function design, we conducted two types of data collection: user interviews and questionnaires. The detailed plan and implementation results are as follows:</p>

        <h3>3.1 Interview Plan</h3>
        <h4>3.1.1 Interview Objectives</h4>
        <p>Deeply understand the travel pain points, existing navigation app experience, and functional expectations of core target users (wheelchair users, visually impaired individuals, the elderly, temporarily injured people).</p>

        <h4>3.1.2 Interview Objects</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 wheelchair user (64-year-old Ms. Li, long-term wheelchair user)</li>
            <li>1 visually impaired individual (45-year-old Mr. Zhang, congenital visual impairment, using cane + screen-reading software)</li>
            <li>1 elderly person (68-year-old Grandpa Wang, mild arthritis, using cane)</li>
            <li>1 temporarily injured person (28-year-old Mr. Zhao, left leg fracture, using crutches for 1 month)</li>
            <li>Total: 4 potential users, covering all core target user groups</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3.1.3 Interview Process & Content</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Intro (5 mins): Explain the purpose of the interview, duration (20-25 mins), confidentiality commitment, and obtain user consent for recording</li>
            <li>Warm-up (5 mins): Understand daily travel methods, travel scenarios (e.g., going to hospital, shopping), and use of current navigation apps</li>
            <li>Main Body (15 mins): Focus on 3 topics with follow-up questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Topic 1: Mobility challenges (recent travel barriers, coping methods, cases of giving up going out)</li>
                    <li>Topic 2: Information trust (ways to confirm accessibility facilities, trust in user-shared information, preferences for voice/vibration prompts)</li>
                    <li>Topic 3: Functional expectations (priority factors for route planning, willingness to participate in crowdsourcing, interface interaction suggestions)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Closing (5 mins): Collect additional user suggestions and thank users for their participation</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3.1.4 Interview Results</h4>
        <p>Completed 4 interview transcripts, collected key insights such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Wheelchair users need real-time updates on elevator/ramp status and accessible toilet locations</li>
            <li>Visually impaired individuals require accurate voice prompts with distance information (e.g., "turn left after 10 meters") and vibration navigation</li>
            <li>The elderly prefer large buttons, large fonts, and a "senior mode" (simplified functions like "check bus," "find toilet")</li>
            <li>Temporarily injured people expect route planning to avoid steps/narrow ramps and link to ride-hailing software</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Survey Plan</h3>
        <h4>3.2.1 Survey Objectives</h4>
        <p>Quantify user needs, verify interview insights, and understand the willingness to use the app and functional preferences of a larger range of potential users.</p>

        <h4>3.2.2 Survey Objects</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Total: 10 potential users, covering 5 user types:
                <ul>
                    <li>2 wheelchair users</li>
                    <li>2 visually impaired individuals</li>
                    <li>3 elderly people (over 60)</li>
                    <li>2 temporarily injured people</li>
                    <li>1 ordinary person (taking care of wheelchair-using relatives)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3.2.3 Survey Content</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic information: Age group, user type, weekly travel frequency, commonly used navigation apps</li>
            <li>Accessibility needs: Frequency of confirming accessibility routes before going out, pain points of current navigation apps</li>
            <li>Functional preferences: Willingness to use the AccessMap app, importance ranking of core functions (e.g., real-time status, one-click emergency assistance)</li>
            <li>Interaction preferences: Preferred text size, interaction methods (e.g., touch screen, voice control), trust in user-shared information</li>
            <li>Concerns & suggestions: Worries about crowdsourced information (e.g., outdated information, privacy leakage) and suggestions for app optimization</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3.2.4 Survey Results</h4>
        <p>Collected 10 sets of raw questionnaire data, with key quantitative conclusions:
        <ul>
            <li>80% of respondents are "very willing" or "relatively willing" to use the AccessMap app</li>
            <li>Top 3 important functions: Real-time elevator/ramp status (8 users ranked top 2), one-click emergency assistance (100% of the elderly/temporarily injured ranked top 3), voice + vibration navigation (100% of visually impaired individuals ranked top 1)</li>
            <li>Interaction preferences: The elderly prefer "larger text" + "voice control"; visually impaired individuals prefer "adjustable text size" + "gesture + voice"; others prefer "standard text size" + "touch screen control"</li>
            <li>Crowdsourcing willingness: 100% of wheelchair users/visually impaired individuals are willing to participate in crowdsourcing; 60% of the elderly are unwilling (due to complex operations)</li>
        </ul>
